## CI/CD Info:  
Our CI/CD is set up using github actions, you can view the .github/workflows/run_test_suite.yml file for exact details. It is set up to run the test suite on any push to any branch. If any test failures occur in the test suite then the workflow fails and an email is sent to alert the pusher/committer.

# tourny - Tournament Simulator

A Python package to simulate single-elimination tournaments.

## Sub-Package 1 (structure) Module 1 (foundation)

Holds classes for Teams, Matches, Rounds, and Tournaments. Together they can be used to simulate single-elimination tournaments. Sub-classes have been defined for HogwartsHouse, Superhero, ChessPlayer, and HockeyTeam using inheritance to simulate tournaments between different types of teams.

Functions:

1. Tournament.__init(self, teams, pairingType)__  
  
    ATTENTION! The "teams" parameter of this constructor must be a list of team objects of LENGTH 2^x (a power of 2), where x is a positive integer. Otherwise the package cannot be used properly.

2. Team.probabilityOfWinning(opponent)  
  
    Determines and returns the probability of the team winning a match against the 'opponent'.

    **USES EXCPETION HANDLER (1/6)** to catch instances of division by 0 when calculating the probability.
  
    **return value** - the probability value between 0 and 1.  
    **parameter - opponent** - the opponent variable of object type "Team".
   
4. Match.runMatch()  
  
    Simulates the match between the 2 associated team objects of this Match instance. Stores the winner team object in the winner attribute of the Match instance.  
  
    **return value** - None

5. Round.runRound()  
  
    Runs all the matches of this Round instance (in the matches attribute).

6. Tournament.addRound(teams)  
  
    Adds the next round of matches (Round object) in the tournament to the rounds attribute (list of round objects) of the current Tournament instance. The order for the round of matches is determined from the Tournaments pairing attribute.  
  
    **return value** - None  
    **parameter - teams** - the list of Team objects that are up for the next round.

7. Tournament.runTournament()  
  
    Runs the entire tournament, determining the teams for the first round from the Tournament instance teams attribute and the addRound method.  
  
    **return value** - None

## Sub-Package 1 (structure) Module 2 (teams)
